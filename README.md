# ASE Assignment 3 (React + TypeScript)

This project was created as part of Assignment 3 for the **Advanced Software Engineering** course.

The goal was to follow along with a tutorial to understand React fundamentals, including components, props, state, and event handling — and then build a fully working UI using React with TypeScript and Bootstrap.

#  Objective

- Understand the basics of React component-based architecture
- Use TypeScript for strong typing in props and state
- Apply Bootstrap styling for responsive UI components
- Practice event handling and dynamic rendering in React
- Learn and use Vite as a modern build tool

#  Features Implemented

- **ListGroup** – A selectable list of items using props and internal state
- **Button** – Reusable, styled button component with color and click handling
- **Alert** – Dismissible alert with Bootstrap styling
- **App Integration** – Conditional rendering and component composition
